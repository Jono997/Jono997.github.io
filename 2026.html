                <h1>So, it's 2026</h1>
                <p>I think it's safe to say that the last year was tumultuous for all of us, both in ways common and unique to all of us, and it was no exception for me. 2024 already wasn't a great year for me, to the point where the thing I yelled as the clock struck midnight on the 1st of January, 2025, was, and I quote, "GO FUCK YOURSELF, 2024, YOU'RE FINALLY OVER!"</p>
                <p>Never in my life has a statement been simultaneously so true and something I'd want to take back so badly at the same time. For all the shit 2024 gave me, 2025 brought even greater hardships. In fact, let's just get those out of the way.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>A shortlist of all* the bad shit</h2>
                    <p>* All the bad shit that was personal to me. I'm not going to get into the global/political stuff that we all dealt with, more than enough people have said everything I could hope to on that.</p>
                    <p>Now on to the things that specifically affected me. My mental and physical health went down the gutter this past year. I've been eating worse and feeling worse, and also not exercising nearly as much as I need to. I do go to the gym once a week and though I train hard, it's not enough, it's nowhere near enough.</p>
                    <p>I lost a friendship of almost 10 years right at the start of the year. I'll keep the details vague because it's very much personal to me, but there was an incident mid-to-late January where I honestly thought I could've lost everything I had (it ended up being a total nothingburger at the end of the day, but I sure as hell didn't know that at the time). I turned to a friend for comfort, a friend who I met in high school and always kept in touch with, a friend who started working in the same office as me a few years prior,<br />
                    ... A friend who didn't even wait until I was out of earshot to blurt it out in front of half of my coworkers.<br />
                    I felt incredibly betrayed by their actions and ended up cutting things off with them after they opted to give me the cold shoulder rather than apologise. To make matters worse, after they cut things off they would throw what can only be described as temper tantrums whenever we crossed paths, which, considering we still worked together, was often. I'm honestly surprised HR never got involved. In the last few months they have been talking to me again, but things'll never be the same again, and after some reflection on our friendship, I don't think I'd want it to be.</p>
                    <p>I also lost people close to me in a much more permanent way. Both my grandfather and my uncle passed away this year, not even six months apart from each other. I'm admittedly not the kind of person to make memories with people, just them being around is enough for me. But even so, their respective passings hurt me a lot. There is a definite hole in my life where they both once were and it's one I know will never be filled. I miss you both so much.</p>
                    <p>I ended up overworking myself to the point of burnout and physical injury multiple times. Between my day job, all the wikis I run, the games I'm working on, and starting November the year before, the Rizline Chart Views YouTube channel, I am constantly stretched incredibly thin, and in spite of my best efforts to delegate and cut back wherever possible I'm still left dealing with the majority of the work a lot of the time. My to do list could pass for a short story most of the time and while I do try and gradually work through everything at a healthy pace, I tend to go into a manic workaholic frenzy when the chips are down, only to not snap out of it until days, weeks, or even months after everything's calmed down. I slip into fight or flight like it's second nature and it takes conscious acknowledgment and effort to get out of it again, acknowledgment and effort that are hard to scrounge together when I'm in that state to begin with. This has led to many issues both in 2025 and in years past, but this year it got so bad it gave me an actual wrist injury that put me out of commission for over a month. That was one of the most miserable moments I'd had all year, especially since it was right off the heels of my uncle's passing and I was throwing myself into work to try and not think about it, which left me dealing with no ability to work or do anything, arguably right when I needed it the most. I spent a lot of time crying over that month.</p>
                    <p>Okay, that's enough, I don't want to write about this any more, I need to move on.</p>

                    <h2>Some good things that happened</h2>
                    <p>I'll start with the big one: My first game I had a big hand in, vivid/stasis, finally left public access and hit its full release on Steam! I have worked on games before, most notably as a charter for Phigros, but that was a very small gig, only amounting to seven charts total. vivid/stasis, on the other hand, I had a much bigger hand in, being one of the main programmers, with also some jacket illustration and UI design on the side. I am legitimately so proud of what the team and I accomplished with this game, and I'm looking forward to working with the team in the future if I get the chance! Please go play the game if you haven't already, it's 100% free on Steam and honestly has one of the best written stories in a rhythm game I've ever seen; if it weren't for the fact I helped make it, I'd say it's one of my favourite games of all time!</p>
                    <p>As I offhanded mentioned earlier, in 2024 I started Rizline Chart Views, a YouTube channel showcasing charts in the game Rizline by Pigeon Games and last year the channel,<ul>
                        <li>Had its 1st anniversary</li>
                        <li>Uploaded chart views of every song in the game</li>
                        <li>Hit 200 subscribers</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Granted, I'm no stranger to having channels of that size, but this is the fastest-growing of any of my channels and I'm amazed at how it's gone so far. Not that I'm only in it for the views or anything, this channel has a very rigid purpose and I intend to keep at it no matter how much attention it gathers, simply because it's a resource that I think should exist. I also made a one-year anniversary special video where I "revealed" who was running the channel (it was in the channel description the whole time, but very few people noticed), and I was surprised to see that NerSAN, one of the charters for Rizline, followed the channel! It's always fun when you make a thing to do with a game and then that thing gets recognised by the developers of said game (well, at least it is when they do something other than take down the thing you made).</p>
                    <p>And lastly, I managed to tick off one goal I had for the year and become a VTuber! Well, a PNGTuber to be more specific, but it still counts. This was VERY recent, to the point I've only done two streams at the time of writing, but it's something, and I'm looking to do more in 2026 because I'm honestly having a lot of fun with it! Hell, it might even become a second source of income if I'm lucky, but I'm not counting on it, haha. Another thing I'm not doing is linking to said channel. I kinda wanna keep my VTubing endeavours separate from the rest of my online presence and while I don't mind people knowing that said VTuber and Jono99 are one and the same, I'm not going to make finding that out easier for anyone. That being said, if you know me already, it's blatanly obvious said vtuber is me haha.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>So, what's planned for 2026?</h2>
                    <p>Admittedly I don't entirely know what I'm gonna do for the year ahead, but I have some goals I want to achieve, most of which are actually carry-overs from my 2025 goals because the VTubing one ended up being the only one I managed to do.</p>

                    <h3>Get the Arcaea Wiki off of FANDOM</h3>
                    <p>It's pretty clear at this point that FANDOM is dogshit and I do not want to support their business practices. That being said, all of my wikis except for one are hosted on there, so I'm kinda stuck unless I can migrate them elsewhere, which I 100% plan to do. The big dream here is to make a new website that hosts information for all the games I run wikis for in a way that not only is easy to edit and maintain for each game individually, but also allows for information to be compared across games. A massive task, I will admit, but that's why I'm not starting there and instead am focusing on getting just the Arcaea Wiki moved over, to make sure I can do that and not have whatever (un)lucky servers host it set fire to my bank account in the process.</p>

                    <h3>Expand my VTubing endeavours</h3>
                    <p>While I did make a start on VTubing this year by starting to stream at all, I've yet to get a consistent schedule in place, which admittedly is partially to do with how I am still moving back and forth between my parents' respective houses, only one of which is actually equipped for streaming. The plan is to turn a bedroom-turned-dumping ground at the house I currently can't stream at into a study of sorts which I would be able to stream from. Still won't be as good as the setup I currently have (not to say that setup is by any means perfect either), but it'll hopefully get the job done.</p>
                    <p>I also want to get a proper Live2D model, but I'm being very hesitant on that for now because I don't know what support there is for VTubing software on Linux, which while I'm not on yet I intend to be soon, and I want to make sure that using a Live2D model is even possible before I spend the several hundred dollars minimum it'll likely cost to get a model made (and for lore reasons it's likely not gonna be just one model).</p>

                    <h3>Start development of my own game(s)</h3>
                    <p>"Wait, didn't you just say that you made a game that released last year?" Yes, yes I did, but there was one important thing that has been neglected in that statement: I was not on vivid/stasis's development team from the beginning, nor was I the director for the game. I was picked up along the way and while I did have a good amount of freedom to do things how I liked, I was very much beholden to what Cheryl wanted (not a complaint, that's literally her job as the director of the game). I want to see what I can do when I'm the one calling the shots. Admittedly I've had quite a few game ideas cooking for over half a decade at this point, and I'm honestly kinda struggling to narrow it down to just one to tackle first. I kind of have a team together already, but at the moment we're very much just throwing ideas back and forth to figure out where to take them. The plan I'm hoping for is to get something presentable this year, and something shipped by 2027, but this is a colossal endeavour.  
I'm going to be honest, I don't think I can do this one, but I refuse to not try at the very least. If nothing else, it'll be a good learning experience.</p>

                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope I can make more of this year than the one that came before it.</p>
